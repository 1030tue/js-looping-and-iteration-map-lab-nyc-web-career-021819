# Map Lab

## Overview

In this lab, we'll use the `map` method to write functions that properly query our data.

## Instructions

Be sure to run the tests to get a feel for the types of problems this lab is
asking you to solve.

You'll be writing four functions:

 * `lowerCaseDrivers` - this function takes in an array of drivers and returns an array of the drivers with each name in lower case.
 * `nameToAttributes` - this function takes in array of drivers first and last names separated by a space and returns an of JavaScript object with attributes of `firstName` and `lastName` for each corresponding element.
 * `attributesToPhrase` - function takes in array of JavaScript objects and returns a string saying "name is from hometown" for element JavaScript object in the array.
